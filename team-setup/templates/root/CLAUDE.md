# Rosetta — Engineering Workspace

This is a **Rosetta** engineering workspace. Chronicle is the memory; Wayfinder
is the guide. Engine repos (`rosetta_*`) live under
[Rosetta-Foundation](https://github.com/Rosetta-Foundation). Consumer product
repos, when present, live in the consumer's own GitHub org and are listed only
in that consumer's workspace config — never hardcoded upstream.

Agent tooling is dual-compatible: **Claude Code** and **Cursor Agent / CLI**.
See `AGENTS.md` for the Cursor-oriented map; this file is the shared brief both
tools load.

## Domain guardrails

Consumers own domain policy (what must never enter git, what surfaces are
forbidden, what "verified" means). Declare it in the consumer's docs and in
`.sdlc/` contracts — not by patching Rosetta engine defaults. See
[ADR-0009](https://github.com/Rosetta-Foundation/rosetta_docs/blob/main/architecture/ADR-0009-platform-boundary-mechanism-vs-policy.md).

## Foundations — Read First

`rosetta_docs/foundations/` is the project's constitution — founding context,
manifesto, principles, glossary, and settled decisions. Read it before making
architectural or product decisions. When implementation and philosophy
conflict, philosophy wins.

## Chronicle Build Charter

When implementing Chronicle (engine, source graph, vault, specimens), read
`rosetta_docs/process/chronicle-build-charter.md` and the private current-state
checkpoint named there. Work inside GREEN. Stop at YELLOW/RED. Do not invent
ontology because a prompt named it.

## SDLC drops (default for inbox work)

When the ask is a GitHub issue (or a small set) that should land as **one PR**:

- Follow **`sdlc-drop`** — `sdlc-workflow drop` arms one worktree, implement
  as commits, `drop --finish` opens the PR, then `pr-approve-watch`.
- Slash reminder: `/sdlc-drop`.
- Do **not** `decompose` a drop into per-task PRs.

`--finish` does **not** wait on reviewer, CI, or AC. For `direct` it then
calls `gh pr merge`. That succeeds when protection does not require a
person — Foundation `main` today requires status checks (`test`, DCO) only,
not approving reviews. Pass **`--require-approve`** when human Approve /
GHA merge-on-approve must stay the proceed signal. `BRANCH_PROTECTION_REQUIRES_HUMAN`
only fires when protection actually requires a review.

## SDLC runs (spec-task opt-in)

When kicking off or watching `sdlc-workflow` (`run` / shadow waves) for an
Accepted multi-task spec:

- Follow **`sdlc-run-supervise`** — engine `--supervise --detach`, `--heartbeat`,
  yield the agent turn, check in on wakes. Do **not** block the chat on
  sandbox/CI waits.
- Slash reminder: `/sdlc-run`. Scorecards: `/sdlc-status`.
- Design note: `rosetta_dev-scripts/sdlc-workflow/docs/operator-background-supervise.md`.

## PR Approve watch (proceed signal)

When you open a PR that needs a human proceed (especially Addi / bot-authored
PRs): follow **`pr-approve-watch`** — arm the background Approve watcher, wake
on `AGENT_LOOP_WAKE_pr_approve`, triage review comments. If the repo enables
**Addi merge on Approve** (GHA), do **not** merge from the agent — pull the
default branch after GHA merges. Otherwise merge as Addi, then pull. Do **not**
treat chat "approved" as the proceed signal. Slash: `/watch-pr-approve`. See
`rosetta_dev-scripts/team-setup/docs/addi-pr-automation-standard.md`.

## Work intake and stakeholder verify

Intake (transcripts, Slack, a domain inbox, prompts) is **not** the
backlog — promote it. GitHub Issues are the engineering ledger
(`direct` / `bug-spec` / `plan`). PRDs are the product contract; ADRs
are decisions that must still bind in a year. A same-sitting **bundle**
is one drop — do not write a PRD for it. User-facing sandbox drops
write dated `docs/releases/` (**Delivered** / **Not verified** /
**Verified**) and upsert the same smoke lines to Slack **Sandbox
verify**. Stakeholders who do not use GitHub check Verified or Failed
there. Slack is the live ledger — do not poll it from a laptop; do not
relay check-offs. Slash: `/watch-stakeholder-verify` (publish only).
DEV hosts are **SB / Sandbox** with stakeholders. When the operator
linked a Slack thread as the ask, reply **in that thread** after the
fix is deployed to SB — not on push or CI. Policy:
[`rosetta_docs/architecture/sdlc/work-intake-and-ship-verify.md`](https://github.com/Rosetta-Foundation/rosetta_docs/blob/main/architecture/sdlc/work-intake-and-ship-verify.md).

## Package Manager

Always use `bun` over `npm`/`yarn` (`bun install`, `bun run <script>`).

## Environment Setup

- Node v20+ (check `.nvmrc` in each repo) — still the runtime for CLIs, jest, and Vite
- Bun 1.3+ (package manager — `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated
- At least one AI agent CLI:
  - Claude Code (`claude`), and/or
  - Cursor Agent CLI (`agent` — `curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash` then `agent login`)

## Folder Structure

```
rosetta/
├── rosetta_dev-scripts/     Workspace tooling (team-setup + sdlc-workflow)
├── rosetta_docs/            PRDs, ADRs, foundations
├── rosetta_chronicle/       Memory engine
├── rosetta_wayfinder/       Knowledge guide
└── rosetta_chronicle_<you>/ Personal chronicle (in your GitHub account)
```

Consumer workspaces add their own product repos beside these. Each repo has a
`CLAUDE.md` describing its purpose and structure.

## Architecture — Handler / Service / Repository (MANDATORY)

All TypeScript code in every Rosetta repo MUST follow the
Handler / Service / Repository pattern with InversifyJS dependency injection. This is a project
standard, enforced the same way as Conventional Commits and the PR review cycles below.

The full ruleset lives in `.claude/rules/architecture-hsr.md` (Claude Code) and is mirrored to
`.cursor/rules/architecture-hsr.mdc` (Cursor) by team-setup. In brief:

- Strict one-way dependency: **Handler → Service → Repository**.
- Every class is `@injectable()`; dependencies are constructor-injected via `@inject(TOKEN)`.
- Tokens are `Symbol.for(...)` values collected in a `*_TOKENS` const; the token — not the
  interface — is the runtime injection key.
- Each class file co-locates its `interface IFoo` and `@injectable() class Foo implements IFoo`.

Read the architecture rule before writing or reviewing any TypeScript.

## Documentation sync

Treat documentation drift as an engineering problem — the same class as test
drift. The documented model, implemented model, and accepted architectural
model should agree. Do not present unimplemented capabilities as complete, and
do not imply that source records are Activity.

Standing order: `.claude/rules/documentation-sync.md` (mirrored to
`.cursor/rules/documentation-sync.mdc`). Canonical text:
`rosetta_dev-scripts/team-setup/docs/documentation-sync.md`. Engine-local copy:
`rosetta_chronicle/docs/documentation-sync.md`.

PRs that change behavior, architecture, CLI, schema, source support, or
privacy boundaries must update documentation in the same change.

## Git Workflow

### Starting work

**Inbox / direct issues use a drop** (`sdlc/drop/<id>` via `sdlc-workflow drop`)
— see **SDLC drops** above. Hand-cut `f/` / `b/` branches stay valid for
work that is not going through the drop CLI.

**Always sync the default branch before creating a feature branch.** The first step of any
new task — before writing code or even analyzing — is to get onto an up-to-date `main`. Never
branch from a stale or arbitrary current branch.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
git checkout -b f/TICKET-123-short-description
```

Branch prefixes: `f/` for features, `b/` for bugs. Drop branches are
`sdlc/drop/<id>`.

**Stacked branches — chain when overlapping.** Before branching, check whether the new work
modifies a file that one of your **open PRs** already modifies (canonical case: the ADR/PRD
records tables in `rosetta_docs`). If it does, branch from that PR's branch instead of `main`
and open the PR against it:

```bash
git checkout f/parent-branch
git checkout -b f/child-branch
# ...work, commit, push...
gh pr create --fill --base f/parent-branch
```

Merge stacks bottom-up (parent first). When the parent merges, GitHub automatically retargets
the child PR onto `main` — no conflict, no rebase. Stacked PRs require merge commits (never
squash-merge a stack). Unrelated work keeps branching from `main` so PRs stay independently
mergeable — do not chain by default.

**Default: do not commit on `main`.** All product work lands via a topic branch + PR.

### Direct commits to `main` (exceptions)

Topic branches are the default. Direct pushes to `main` are allowed only when a human
explicitly authorizes it for one of these cases:

1. **Foundation / bootstrap scaffolding** — standing up shared tooling across repos
   (e.g. husky, org-wide config, one-shot public repo initialization).
2. **Emergency hotfix** — a production-blocking fix where a human approves skipping the
   branch+PR cycle. Prefer a follow-up PR note when practical.

Even on an exception, **Conventional Commits still apply**. If authorization is unclear,
ask — do not assume.

### Commit messages — Conventional Commits

**Branch has a ticket** (e.g. `f/PROJ-123`): the ticket must be the scope.

```
feat(PROJ-123): add chronicle git source adapter
fix(PROJ-456): handle empty commit ranges correctly
```

**Branch has no ticket** (e.g. `f/my-cool-feature`): standard Conventional Commits.

```
feat: add chronicle git source adapter
fix(sources): handle empty commit ranges
```

Valid types: `feat` `fix` `chore` `docs` `style` `refactor` `perf` `test` `build` `ci` `revert` `chronicle`

`chronicle` is reserved for **machine-authored ledger commits** — commits written
by Chronicle machinery into ledger repos, e.g. `chronicle(daily): 2026-07-31`
(ADR-0007 in rosetta_docs). Humans never hand-write it; code changes to the
Chronicle product use normal types.

Breaking changes append `!` after the type/scope: `feat(PROJ-123)!: drop Node 18 support`.

**Sign-off is mandatory (DCO).** Every commit certifies the
[Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org) — always commit with
`git commit -s` so the `Signed-off-by:` trailer is present. PRs fail the DCO check without it.
See each repo's `CONTRIBUTING.md`. There is no CLA.

### Finishing work

When work is complete, push the branch and open a PR **as Addi** (never as the
human `gh` user — humans must Approve agent PRs):

```bash
eval "$(bash ~/.config/rosetta/github-app-activate.sh)"
gh api graphql -f query='query { viewer { login } }' --jq '.data.viewer.login'  # must be *addi*[bot]
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --title "…" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
…
EOF
)"
```

Consumer workspaces use their own activate script under `~/.config/<workspace>/`
instead. See `.claude/rules/addi-authorship.md`. Same rule for `gh issue create`.

**No tool marketing in PR bodies or commits.** Never include `Made with Cursor`,
`Made-with: Cursor`, or similar AI-tool footers/trailers. Prefer `--body` /
`--body-file` HEREDOCs. If Cursor still injects a footer after create (known
bug even with attribution off), strip it with `gh pr edit` before the PR is
ready. Operators: turn off Cursor Settings → Attribution (commits + PRs) and
keep `attribution.attributePRsToAgent: false` in `~/.cursor/cli-config.json`
only (project `.cursor/cli.json` may contain `permissions` only — see rule
`no-tool-attribution`).

**Immediately after pushing, return to an up-to-date default branch** — do not linger on the
feature branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
```

This keeps the local default branch current and leaves the working tree clean between tasks.
Auto-branch-deletion on merge is enabled org-side, so the remote feature branch is removed
automatically once the PR merges; delete the local branch when you next sync.

### Copilot review cycle

After opening or pushing to a PR, GitHub Copilot posts an automated review (typically within 5 minutes). **You must process this before considering the PR ready.**

1. First check if Copilot is enabled on this repo: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=closed&per_page=5` and check any of those PR's reviews for `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]`. If none found, skip the entire cycle — Copilot is not enabled on this repo.
2. If enabled, poll `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews` every 30 seconds for up to 10 minutes, stopping as soon as a `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]` review appears.
3. Read the review body for the overview summary and check `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments` for inline thread comments. Copilot always posts a review body even when it has no inline comments — "generated no new comments" means nothing to address.
4. Evaluate each inline comment — address anything that is a genuine improvement (dead code, duplicate imports, misleading patterns, correctness issues). Dismiss comments that are stylistic noise or false positives.
5. Fix, commit, and push (use `fix(<scope>): address Copilot review comments` or a more specific message).
6. Reply to each addressed comment with the fix commit SHA and a brief explanation.
7. Resolve each addressed thread via the GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation.
8. Run this cycle **once** — if Copilot posts new comments on the fix commit, flag them for human review rather than looping indefinitely.

### PR checks review cycle

After pushing to a PR, required status checks (CI) run automatically. **You must monitor and fix failing checks.** This cycle runs in parallel with the Copilot review cycle.

1. Poll `gh run list --branch {branch} --limit 5 --json status,conclusion,name,databaseId` every 30 seconds until all runs reach a terminal state (`completed`, `cancelled`, `failure`), up to 15 minutes.
2. If all checks pass, the cycle is done.
3. If any check fails:
   a. Retrieve logs: `gh run view {run-id} --log-failed`
   b. Diagnose the failure — read the error output and identify the root cause.
   c. Fix the issue locally, commit with an appropriate message (e.g. `fix(<scope>): correct type error caught by CI`), and push.
   d. Return to step 1 — poll the new run.
4. Repeat until all checks pass, up to **3 iterations**. If checks still fail after 3 fix attempts, flag for human review with a summary of what was tried and what remains broken.

### Cleaning up

After the PR is approved and merged, switch back to main and delete the local branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -d f/TICKET-123-short-description
```
