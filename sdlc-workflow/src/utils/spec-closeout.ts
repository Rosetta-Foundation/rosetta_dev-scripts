 * Pure: takes the spec markdown as it exists on the default branch and

 * hand-written annotation survive untouched — only the checkbox character and
 * the frontmatter status value are ever rewritten, so this is safe to run
 * against a spec a human has been editing.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Two deliberate asymmetries, both in the direction of never destroying
 * evidence:
 *
 * - A box already ticked on disk is **never** unticked, even with no verdict
 *   behind it. A hand tick is a human's record of hand verification (this
 *   engine's own specs were closed out that way), and silently clearing it
 *   would lose information no other artifact holds. Such criteria are
 *   reported as {@link CloseoutEdit.unverifiedTicks} and still count as
 *   remainder, so they cannot buy a `status: Done` they have not earned.
 * - `status:` is only ever written *forward* to `Done`, and only on full
 *   coverage. Partial coverage leaves the prior value exactly as it was —
 *   gaps surface as the remainder list, never as a downgrade.
