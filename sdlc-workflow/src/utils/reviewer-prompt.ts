/**
 * Build the reviewer-agent prompt (SPEC-PRD-0011-P2 T-05). Independence is
 * structural: built from exactly the diff, the spec task, the envelope,
 * and (when declared) the repo's review checklist — never from
 * implementation-agent conversation state.
 *
 * Includes the workspace documentation bar (TSDoc/JSDoc) and the
 * architecture bar (substitutability). `checklist` omitted (undefined)
 * reproduces the pre-checklist prompt byte-for-byte
 * (SPEC-BUG-reviewer-house-bar-P1 T-01 no-regression requirement).
 *
 * @remarks
 * This prompt is the upstream default, so it stays domain-neutral: a consumer's
 * rules ("never log a payment-card number") arrive through
 * `.sdlc/review-checklist.md`, which is the seam ADR-0009 requires policy to
 * travel through. A domain example baked in here would ship one consumer's
 * vocabulary to every other one.
